This is a work in progress adaptable template repository designed to help students in the University of Borås' Digitizing Cultural Herirate Materials course to develop their own website for presenting their digitisation projects, hosted on GitHub. A more elaborate example can be found in Wout's [DIY-frankensTEIn](https://woutdln.github.io/DIY-frankensTEIn/index.html) repository.
